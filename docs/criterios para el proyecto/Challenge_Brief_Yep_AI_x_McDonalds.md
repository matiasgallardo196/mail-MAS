A Multi-Agent Workforce
Scheduling System for 
McDonald’s Operations
WWW. YEPAI.IOFrom online products to physical retail operation, we started by solving
workforce scheduling for McDonald's Australia— complex labor laws,
unpredictable demand spikes, and limited employee availability
through multi-agent collaboration.

The Scheduling 
Challenge, Magnified
Across 1,000+ Stores
Workforce scheduling is the operational heartbeat of restaurants. For
a single store, it's a puzzle. At our scale, it's an exponential challenge
affecting hundreds of thousands of employees daily.

The New Way: The Algorithmic Manager
<180 seconds for a 2-week roster generation
Optimized coverage for all peak periods
Balances business needs with employee preferences
Proactive conflict detection and automated resolution
The Battlefield: From Manual Chaos to AI-Driven System
The Old Way: Manual Scheduling
4–8 hours of manual work per week
Prone to coverage gaps & overtime violations
Results in employee dissatisfaction and high turnover
Reactive conflict resolution

Your Mission
Design and implement a cutting-edge multi-agent
system to replace traditional, manual restaurant
workforce scheduling.
Your system will leverage real-world operational
data to intelligently generate staff rosters that
optimize coverage, respect complex constraints,
and resolve conflicts automatically.
You are not just building a scheduler; you are
creating the brain of the modern, efficient
algorithmic manager.Engineer an Intelligent Scheduling System

Business Goals
Design Multi-Agent Architectures
Architect a multi-agent system with clearly defined
agent roles and responsibilities
Implement agent communication protocols and
coordination mechanisms
Apply appropriate agent architectures (reactive,
deliberative, or hybrid)Apply Constraint Satisfaction Techniques
Model scheduling as a constraint satisfaction
problem (CSP)
Implement constraint checking and conflict
resolution algorithms
Balance hard constraints (must satisfy) vs soft
constraints (should optimize)
Optimize Complex Real-World Problems
Develop optimization strategies for multi-objective
scheduling problems
Balance competing priorities (coverage, costs,
employee preferences)
Implement heuristics for NP-hard scheduling
problems Integrate Domain Knowledge
Incorporate restaurant operations domain knowledge
into system design (Store Info)
Apply labor law compliance requirements (Australian
Fair Work Act)
Model real-world business constraints and peak
demand patterns 
Objectives

Architect a Society of Intelligent Multi-Agents
Key Concepts to Implement:
Agent Definition: Clearly define the roles,
responsibilities, and decision-making logic for each
agent in your system.
Communication & Coordination: Implement
protocols for agents to negotiate, share information,
and work towards a common goal.
Architecture Choice: Apply the appropriate agent
architecture (reactive, deliberative, or a hybrid) to
solve the scheduling problem effectively.

Balancing Competing Priorities with Precision
Constraint Satisfaction Problem(CSP)Model the entire schedule as a complex CSP.
Hard Constraints: Enforce non-negotiable rules
(e.g., store info, labor laws, fixed hours, skill
requirements for each station).
Soft Constraints: Optimize for desirable outcomes
(e.g., employee preferences, minimizing costs).

Success Criteria 1&2 : 
Intelligent Generation & Peak Coverage
Goal: Automatically generate complete, conflict-free
weekly/monthly rosters.
Criteria: Schedules all 40 employees without conflicts in
one store; Complies with 100% of hard constraints;
Generates a 2-week roster in under 180 seconds.Goal: Ensure optimal staffing during high-traffic periods.
Criteria: Meets minimum staffing for lunch peak(11:00–
14:00) & dinner peak (17:00–21:00); Weekend coverage is
20% higher than off-peak weekdays. Opening (06:30)
and closing (23:00) have designated staff1. Intelligent Roster Generation 2. Peak Period Coverage Optimization

Goal: Match employee skills to specific station
requirements.
Criteria: Assigns only kitchen-trained staff to kitchen shifts;
Assigns only barista-certified staff to McCafe shifts; Cross-
trained employees utilized efficiently; Each station has at
least 1 qualified person per shift 3. Conflict Detection & Resolution 4. Employee Skill MatchingSuccess Criteria 3&4 : 
Conflict Resolution & Skill Matching
Goal: Automatically identify and resolve scheduling
conflicts for staffs and managers.
Criteria: Detects all constraint violations before
finalization; Provides clear conflict descriptions &
ranked resolution options by impacts.

Goal: Monitor and enforce all working hour regulations and contractsSuccess Criteria 5: Working Hours Compliance
Full-time: 35-38 hours/week.
Part-time: 20-32 hours/week.
Casual: 8-24 hours/week.
System alerts when an employee approaches max/min hours.
Enforces a minimum 10-hour rest period between shifts (Australia Fair Work Act).
